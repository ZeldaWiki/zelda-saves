Visual Boy Advance save states for the US and EU versions of *A Link to the Past* for Game Boy Advance.

Save states are captured immediately before important state changes, namely an item being obtained.

Some CodeBreaker cheat codes were used and may be loaded along with save states. Cheats can cause the game to freeze in cutscenes and prevent certain gameplay actions such as stepping on Floor Switches or Warp Zones. Simply disable cheats to fix.

Tested on macOS.
